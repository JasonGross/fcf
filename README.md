Foundational Cryptography Framework for machine-checked proofs of cryptography in the computational model.    

Getting Started:
1) cd src/FCF

2) make

Then open a simple example from the “src/examples” directory in Proof General.  A good place to start is “ElGamal.v.”  Interactively step through this proof to learn how to develop a simple proof of non-adaptive security in the concrete setting.  PRF_Encryption_IND_CPA.v contains a more complex proof of adaptive security along with a proof in the asymptotic setting.  

The publications describing FCF are available at adam.petcher.net.
